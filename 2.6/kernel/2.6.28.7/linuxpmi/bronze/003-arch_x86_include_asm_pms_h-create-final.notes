= arch/x86/include/asm/tmig.h =

== Summary ==
This file contains logic for including either tmig32.h or tmig64.h, depending on whether we are compiling for an I386, or an AMD64.

== Details ==
This header includes either tmig64.h or tmig32.h, depending on whether we're compiling for an I386, or an AMD64. If this header is included without defining either 'CONFIG_X86_64' or 'CONFIG_X86_32', we generate an error.
