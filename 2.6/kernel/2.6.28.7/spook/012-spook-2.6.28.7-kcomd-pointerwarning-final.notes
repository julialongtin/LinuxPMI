== Summary ==

This patch fixes a few pointer warnings that result from casting an architecture dependant variable size, to a fixed size int.

== Details ==

Changes the process id offsets to be stored in uintptr_t instead of just int.
when compiling for x86_64 there is a compiler warning about the cast
that is done, because the offset is size=8 and the int * cast is
size=4
I'm sure that this will likely affect other architectures too.
