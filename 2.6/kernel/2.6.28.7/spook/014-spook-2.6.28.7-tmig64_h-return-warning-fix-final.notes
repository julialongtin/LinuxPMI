== Details ==

This adds a return 0; to the end of long arch_get_sys_arg to silence a warning.
in theory, the return should never be reached but all the return 
statements in the function are inside a switch, with no default case.  
and before the switch there is a BUGON assertion if the int is outside 
the bounds dealt with in the switch statement.
