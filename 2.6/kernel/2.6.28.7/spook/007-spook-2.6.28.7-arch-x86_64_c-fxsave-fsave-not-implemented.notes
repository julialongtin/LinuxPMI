== Summary ==

This disables the broken migration between different cpu types for x86_64

== Details ==

disables migration between different cpu types, because;
a) this is the only code i've seen for doing it on x86_64
b) this code doesn't work
c) its not important right now to have this working.

As there is likely only one specific way to do this on x86_64 this will need to be rewritten
