== Summary ==

Fixes the system call table file

== Details ==

Removes what i *think* is junk at the start of the file, as the i386 call table doesn't have it.  this also renames pms_stub_rt_suspend to sys_rt_suspend, as pms_stub_rt_suspend is labeled not_implemented in hpc/proc.h and fails link for some reason.
