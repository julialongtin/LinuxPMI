Todo:

compare the hpc/Makefile's idea of groupings to our defined classes above.
#ifdef is valid in a .S file. make our modifications to entry.S not one-way.
cpu_has_xmm?
find out why we don't migrate vm86 processes. hpa has no idea why we shouldn't.
find or write a program that uses vm86 mode. preferably something simple, like something that writes a result to the console, kicks into vm86, does work, returns from vm86, and starts over..
tests for running EG 486 code on a 386, mmx on a 486, etc. we should migrate back home, and memorize this "gohome reason". it should be takeen into account when migrating out again.
both of the above tests should run in a loop, that takes long enough for us to migrate a process away. they should trigger a migrate home event every few seconds.
merge our test suite with http://ltp.sourceforge.net/, if possible. someone needs to evaluate their work VS our needs. 
find out when it is appropriate to task_lock(current). when task_set_stay is being called?
ask debian legal what licensing issues will be caused by the inclusion of GPLV3 files in the linux kernel.

create a "programming against openmosix howto".
