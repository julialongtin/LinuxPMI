You must have extracted the busybox tarball in this directory.
Use 1.15.2 as that is the version the .config file is for.

To start this initrd, you have to append at least ramdisk_size=34000 or so.
Also, don't forget to append root=/dev/ram0 too.

You need a kernel with ext2 support built-in.

Problems:
Please let me, spook, know of any;
 - nickname "spook" #linuxpmi on irc.freenode.net
 - ash@spooksoftware.com

Happy testing.
